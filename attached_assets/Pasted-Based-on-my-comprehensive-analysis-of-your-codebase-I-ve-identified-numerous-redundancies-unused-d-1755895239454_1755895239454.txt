Based on my comprehensive analysis of your codebase, I've identified numerous redundancies, unused dependencies, and potential optimization opportunities. Here's my detailed audit report:

📁 File & Folder Cleanup Recommendations
Safe to Remove:

client/src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx → Empty file with comment indicating removal
client/src/components/ui/pagination.tsx → Contains only removal comment
attached_assets/Pasted-*.txt files → Multiple pasted text files (5 files)
Duplicate image files in attached_assets/ and client/public/ directories
Review for Deletion:

server/shopify-mcp.ts → Incomplete Shopify MCP implementation with no actual usage
client/src/components/seo-debug.tsx → Debug component that should be development-only
client/src/components/performance-optimizer.tsx → If not actively optimizing performance
🧠 Unused Functions / Variables / Imports
Multiple UI Components Never Referenced:

@radix-ui/react-accordion → No accordion usage found
@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog → No alert dialogs implemented
@radix-ui/react-collapsible → No collapsible components
@radix-ui/react-context-menu → No context menus
@radix-ui/react-menubar → No menubar implementation
@radix-ui/react-progress → No progress bars
@radix-ui/react-radio-group → No radio groups
@radix-ui/react-toggle → No toggle components
@radix-ui/react-toggle-group → No toggle groups
@radix-ui/react-visually-hidden → No accessibility hiding
Unused Form Components:

input-otp → OTP input not implemented
@radix-ui/react-checkbox → No checkboxes in forms
Chart/Data Visualization:

recharts → No charts implemented in current pages
d3-* dependencies → Chart library dependencies unused
Animation & Interaction:

embla-carousel-react → No carousels implemented
Framer Motion causing React context errors (see logs)
📦 Dependency Audit
High-Priority Removals:

@jridgewell/trace-mapping → Redundant with build tools
cmdk → Command palette not implemented
date-fns → Could use native Date if simple operations
react-day-picker → No date pickers in current UI
react-resizable-panels → No resizable panels
vaul → Drawer component unused
input-otp → OTP functionality not needed
Backend Dependencies to Review:

express-rate-limit → No rate limiting configured
express-session → Session management unused
memorystore → Session store unused
passport + passport-local → Authentication not implemented
openai → Used in shop assistant but could be optional
Development Dependencies:

@tailwindcss/typography → Typography styles unused
@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal → Development only
♻️ Code Logic Duplication
Image Handling:

Duplicate case images in both attached_assets/ and client/public/cases/
Similar image loading logic in multiple components
Form Components:

FormDescription and FormMessage have similar error handling patterns
Could be consolidated into a single error component
Navigation:

Navigation logic spread across navbar and potential unused navigation-menu component
🚨 Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention
React Hook Errors (from logs):

"Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component"
"Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')"
Framer Motion causing context issues
Potential React version conflicts
Runtime Errors:

"Uncaught ReferenceError: products is not defined"
ShopPromotion component has undefined variable reference
Missing Error Handling:

Shop data fetching failures not properly handled
No fallback UI for failed API calls
🧽 Optimization Summary
Estimated Removable Content:

Dependencies: ~25 unused packages (estimated 50MB+ reduction)
Files: 8+ unused/empty files
Code: ~300+ lines of unused component code
High-Priority Cleanup Areas:

Fix React hook call errors in Framer Motion usage
Remove unused Radix UI components (accordion, alert-dialog, etc.)
Clean up duplicate image assets
Remove incomplete Shopify MCP implementation
Consolidate form error handling components
Optional Improvements:

Implement tree-shaking for better bundle optimization
Add proper error boundaries for API failures
Create auto-cleanup script for unused imports
Modular restructure of UI components into feature-based folders
Build performance tuning by removing unused dev dependencies
Immediate Action Items:

Fix the products is not defined error in ShopPromotion component
Resolve React context issues with Framer Motion
Remove empty/commented UI component files
Clean up unused Radix UI dependencies to reduce bundle size
This analysis shows significant opportunities for codebase optimization while maintaining functionality. I recommend addressing the critical runtime errors first, then systematically removing unused dependencies and files.
