Storefront MCP server
Connect your AI agent to a specific Shopify store's catalog, shopping cart, and policies. The Storefront MCP server helps customers browse and buy with their selected merchant.

Anchor to How it worksHow it works
The Storefront MCP server lets your AI agent handle shopping tasks for the selected store:

A shopper asks about products while browsing a store.
Your agent searches the store's catalog and manages carts.
The shopper adds items and completes checkout.
Anchor to Connect to the serverConnect to the server
Each Shopify store has its own MCP server endpoint that exposes storefront features. This endpoint handles all server calls for product search, cart operations, and policy questions:

https://storedomain.com/api/mcp
This endpoint is unique to each store and gives access to all storefront commerce capabilities. Your app needs to configure this endpoint based on which store the customer is shopping with.

Caution
By using the Shopify MCP servers, you agree to the Shopify API License and Terms of Use.
